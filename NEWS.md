# SimEvolEnzCons version 1.0.2 (2021-05-31)
* replace \dontrun by \donttest in examples
* export function RNV.compute.elements() (but please rather use RNV.for.simul())
* changement condition in graph.simul.triangle.diagram.e to check if eq_th_select is a matrix or a numeric
* graph.simul.triangle.diagram.e returns "why_no_lines" which explain why options not passed, rather than printed them in the console
* no code line under comments in examples
* save user options for par() when needed (in RNV.mean.simul(), RNV.graph.double.at.eq()) or put away (in graph.simul. functions)
* use message() rather print() to show current simulations in simul.evol.enz.multiple()

# SimEvolEnzCons version 1.0.1 (2021-05-14)
* add ORCID
* some examples with \dontrun
* Changed 'NEWS' to `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.

# SimEvolEnzCons 1.0.0 (2021-05-13)

* First submission to CRAN

# Changements in SimEvolEnzCons version 0.2.1 (2021-04-15)
* minor corrections
  - in simul.evol.enz.one: modification of the predicted equilibrium in simulation when there is some regulation groups (sum(1/B)>1), due to the effective equilibrium not computable in this case

# Changements in SimEvolEnzCons version 0.2.1 (2021-03-26)

* minor adaptation to case regulation plus independence
  - in is.B.accurate: check if sum(1/B) is an integrer (normally equal to the number of regulation groups), and not just equal to 1
  - in flux.shape.from.one.point: add the choice to compute Ejm from alpha computation because computing from tau has no sense when there is regulated and independent enzymes
  - in flux.shape.from.one.point: indication of regulation presence to avoid the tau computing
  
* add the graphics of flux in relation to relative concentration in graph.simul.other.by.sim
  
* bug corrections
  - correction of equilibrium computing in flux.shape.for.all.points
